# Dayblocks

Simplify day management with blocks.

## Motivation

More burden-less daily plan management!

There's a time management solution called ["Block 6"](https://book.interpark.com/product/BookDisplay.do?_method=detail&sc.saNo=001&sc.prdNo=354308432). It divides a day into six blocks to reduce mental burden managing daily plans. But as a university student, I wanted bit more concise time management than that since I have to think about free time between classes to classes.
